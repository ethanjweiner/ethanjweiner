<h1 align="left">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ethan!</h1>

I'm a software engineer with multiple years of experience in full-stack development in the Javascript and Ruby ecosystems.

My passion for software engineering stems from the excitement I felt when I first started building web applications on my own. I had a ton of fun building these apps, but as their complexity grew, I encountered more bugs and they became harder to maintain. This experience sparked a renewed focus on software engineering fundamentals, and over the past 2 years, I have had an incredible learning experience at Launch School, a mastery-based software engineering curriculum focused on fundamentals.

Most recently, I worked with a remote team of three to build [Seamless](https://seamless-cicd.com/), an open-source, low-config CI/CD pipeline for containerized microservices.
