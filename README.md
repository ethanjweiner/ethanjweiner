Hi, I'm Ethan! I'm a software engineer with multiple years of experience in full-stack development, in particular, JavaScript/TypeScript and Ruby. I'm proficient in React, Express, PostgreSQL, Docker, Go, and AWS.

My passion for software engineering stems from the excitement I felt when I first started building applications on my own with technologies such as Javascript, HTML/CSS, Vue.js, and Firebase. I had a ton of fun building these apps, but as their complexity grew, I encountered more bugs and they became harder to maintain. This experience sparked a renewed focus on software engineering fundamentals, and over the past 2 years, I have had an incredible learning experience at Launch School, a mastery-based software engineering curriculum focused on fundamentals.

Most recently, I worked with a remote team of three to build [Seamless](https://seamless-cicd.com/), an open-source, low-config CI/CD pipeline for containerized microservices. I am currently on the lookout for a software engineering role that will enable me to utilize my skills and experience to create a positive impact.
